Doing things with full focus is really important. Here are some tips that I use to stay focused which might be helpful for you as well.

### Remove Distraction

Distraction is something that breaks your focus, so itâ€™s important to remove distractions. Here are some tools and tips to help you remove distraction.

**Tools**

*   [News Feed Eradicatorâ€Šâ€”â€ŠBrowser Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/news-feed-eradicator/fjcldmjmjhkklehbacihaiopjklihlgg?hl=en)
*   [ESUITâ€Šâ€”â€ŠBrowser Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/esuit-ad-blocker-for-face/jkbklfkombochacjoeagggbiohipcbaj)
*   [Digital Wellbeingâ€Šâ€”â€ŠAndroid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.wellbeing&hl=en&gl=US&pli=1)
*   [Screen Timeâ€Šâ€”â€ŠiOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/screen-time/id1232823066)

Use News Feed Eradicator to remove the news feed from Facebook. This will help you focus on the things that matter. Digital Wellbeing/Screen Time is a tool that helps you monitor your phone usage. It will help you see how much time you spend on your phone and how much time you spend on each app. This will help you see how much time you spend on social media and other distractions. Also using Digital Wellbeing you can turn on focus mode where certain apps will be blocked for a certain amount of time.

### **The doâ€™s andÂ donâ€™ts**

**The donâ€™ts**

*   Donâ€™t play videos on Facebook because the algorithm is designed to keep you on the app longer and play more videos.
*   Donâ€™t use the native Facebook app but the web version (facebook.com) if you really need to use Facebook app then keep notifications off.

**The Doâ€™s**

*   Prefer to use a single social media platform.
*   Keep your phone away from you when you are working on things that matter.
*   Set a time limit for social media.

### Focus on one thing at aÂ time

Multitasking seems very productive but itâ€™s not. But from my experience finishing one thing at a time then moving to the next thing is more productive. Here are some tips to help you focus on one thing at a time.

### The doâ€™s andÂ donâ€™ts

**The donâ€™ts**

*   Donâ€™t jump from one task to another unless itâ€™s an emergency.

**The Doâ€™s**

*   Focus on one thing at a time.
*   Set a timer for 25 minutes and work on one thing for 25 minutes and then take a 5 minute break.
*   Use the Pomodoro technique.

### In conclusion

Removing distractions and staying focused is essential for achieving success in todayâ€™s fast-paced world. The tips I shared in this article might be helpful for you with some tweaks based on your preferences.
