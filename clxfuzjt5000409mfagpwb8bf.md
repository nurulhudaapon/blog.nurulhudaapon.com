Typing fast is really important in todays digital world where most of the communication happens through text. It is also important for being productive and efficient at work or school.

**Here are some basic tips to begin typing fast:**

* Learn to use all 10 fingers while typing. (this is called touch typing)
    
* Use a better keyboard. (mechanical keyboards are preferable)
    
* Practice, practice, practice.
    

#### Touch Typing

If you haven’t learn touch typing yet or you know but doesn’t feel comfortable with it, I know the feeling it is hard to get to start feeling comfortable unless you get out of your comfort zone and start practicing. I have been there and I know how it feels but you will eventually start feeling comfortable after few weeks of practice.

**Here are some resources to learn touch typing:**

* [Typing Club](https://www.typingclub.com/)
    
* [Rapid Typing](https://www.rapidtyping.com/)
    
* [Keybr](https://www.keybr.com/)
    

You can try them all and see which one works best for you. I personally like Rapid Typing because it has a lot of lessons and it is free.

#### Keyboard

Keyboard does affect your typing speed a bit. If you are a student, programmer, gamer or anyone who types a lot, I would recommend you to get a mechanical keyboard because they are more compfortable and durable.

**Here are some mechanical keyboards that I loved using:**

* [Keychron K2 Pro](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-pro-qmk-via-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)
    
* [Keychron K2](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k2-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)
    
* [Keychron K6](https://www.keychron.com/products/keychron-k6-wireless-mechanical-keyboard)
    
* [RK Royal Kludge RK84](https://www.techlandbd.com/rk-royal-kludge-rk84-keyboard-red)
    

I personally like simpler design and smaller keyboard as I can carry them in my backpack, I use Keychron K2 for that reason. but you can choose any keyboard that you like.

#### Practice

Practice is the key to building muscle memory and getting comfortable and fast at typing. You don’t have to practice for hours, just 5–10 minutes a day is enough. You can practice while chatting with your friends, writing for work/school or anything that involves typing.

**Here are some resources to practice typing:**

* [Monkeytype](https://monkeytype.com/)
    
* [Typing.com](https://www.typing.com/student)
    

Monkeytype is my favorite typing practice website because it is simple and has very modern design. You can also practice typing code with it.

#### Conclusion

I’m 100% sure that if you start typing faster it will make you more productive personal overall. So why not plan and begin practice typing from today?
