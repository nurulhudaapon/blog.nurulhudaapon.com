2024 has been the best year for me so far! I was able to accomplish so much this year that I’m proud of, by the grace of Almighty.

Here is a quick summary of what the events that took place in this year!

* **Job Offers:** I received several job offers at the beginning of the year, but I didn't accept them because I'm very happy at my current job.
    
* **Saint Martin Tour:** It was my first time visiting a beach and an island, and it was fantastic!
    
* **Umrah:** Alhamdulillah, I was able to complete my Umrah by the mercy of the Almighty.
    
* **CodeSamurai’24:** For the first time, I participated in a national hackathon and was part of the winning team, placing 9th.
    
* **Promotion:** I got promoted to the Staff Engineer role at my current workplace.
