2024 has been the best year for me so far! I was able to accomplish so much this year that I’m proud of, by the grace of Almighty.

Here is a quick summary of what the events that took place in this year!

* **Saint Martin Tour:** It was my first time visiting a beach and an island, and it was fantastic!
    
* **Umrah****:** Alhamdulillah, I was able to complete my Umrah by the mercy of the Almighty.
    
* **CodeSamurai’24:** For the first time, I participated in a national hackathon and was part of the winning team, placing 9th.
    
* **Promotion:** I got promoted to the Staff Engineer role at my current workplace.
    

# Saint Martin Tour

**January’24** — Thanks to my awesome university friends for organizing the smooth tour. Initially there weren’t enough tour-mates to be found, but at the end we ended up with 20 people on the tour and for everyone enjoyed the tour.

# Umrah

**March’24** — Based on my current 'one international tour a year' schedule, I was trying to find nearby Middle Eastern countries. Initially, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia came to mind, but then it occurred to me, why not just do the Umrah? So, I booked it with a group of amazing elderly religious people. The Umrah schedule was right in the middle of Ramadan, so it was the best time for Umrah. Our flight had a transit at **Kuwait Airport** from **Dhaka Airport**, where we entered into the state of Ihram. It was an unbelievable feeling! After a 3-hour layover at Kuwait Airport, our flight continued to Jeddah. By around 2 PM local time, we landed in Jeddah and completed immigration. We then began our journey to the holy city of Mecca by bus. Throughout this journey, we were fasting, and because of the time zone difference, it turned out to be the longest fast for all of us. Once we reached our hotel in Mecca, we took a short rest and then broke our fast with Iftar. After the Isha prayer, we went to the Kaaba to perform Tawaf and Sa'ay. For the first time in my life, I shaved my head and exited the state of Ihram.

It was an amazing experience seeing Muslims from all around the world and visiting all the sacred places. We stayed in Mecca for the first week and visited every sacred place and mosque. The next week, we went to Medina and similarly visited all the sacred places and mosques. One interesting thing was that I had to spend some time in Medina coding for the CodeSamurai’24 Hackathon. It was a weird feeling to code while being in Medina, but that’s how my life is. The picture below was taken right in front of the **Al Masjid an Nabawi** ([Prophet's Mosque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet%27s_Mosque)).

# [**CodeSamurai’24**](https://www.codesamuraibd.net/)

It was the first hackathon I ever participated in. I'm not much into competition, but circumstances led me to join this one with my mates [Zahin Afsar](https://zahin.netlify.app/) and [Suaeb Ahmed](https://suaebahmed.github.io/my-portfolio/). We had zero expectations from this competition as we all held full-time jobs and couldn’t afford a vacation at the time. After doing our worst in the mock preliminary, we failed because our program couldn’t even be executed. However, in the actual preliminary, we ended up being 5th out of 400+ registered teams. From the preliminary, 91 teams got selected, and the second phase began (it was basically the main phase) in March '24. Unfortunately, I had a conflict with my Umrah schedule, which began at the same time, making me unable to contribute much for that phase. Anyhow, we got selected for the final onsite, where we were tasked with enhancing what we built for phase 2 and a mobile app. We were lagging behind in phase 2, but somehow (of course, not somehow—we did work hard in the final 24 hours) we made it to the winners' list with rank 9 (the top 10 teams were selected for the winners' list).

# **Promotion**

I’ve been leading the engineering team for a while but finally in June’24 I officially got the promotion to Staff Engineer role.
